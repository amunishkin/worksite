UCSC Work Website Project 1; Interactive K-8 Math Performance

This project is an NSF-funded study for a collaborative team from UCSC,
UT Austin, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), to create an agent-based model 
of data from a data-warehouse accumulated by San Jose Unified School District. The model
was to examine the potential variables that predict 8th grade math performance. UCSC 
provided the educational expertise, LANL developed the model, and UT Austin visualized
the data. The remaining work requires us to take what we have produced and present it to
educational practitioners to determine how useful they find it. We will do this largely
through an interactive website, where individuals can manipulate some of the data and
relate them to their own situations.
