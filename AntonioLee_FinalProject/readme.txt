General Idea: This project is an NSF-funded study for a collaborative team from UCSC,
UT Austin, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), to create an agent-based model 
of data from a data-warehouse accumulated by San Jose Unified School District. The model
was to examine the potential variables that predict 8th grade math performance. UCSC 
provided the educational expertise, LANL developed the model, and UT Austin visualized
the data. The remaining work requires us to take what we have produced and present it to
educational practitioners to determine how useful they find it. We will do this largely
through an interactive website, where individuals can manipulate some of the data and
relate them to their own situations.

Use Cases: Teachers and Principals within the San Jose School District will be able 
to login to the website. Once logged in they will be able to interact with sliders and 
other widgets which correspond to potential variables that might effect 8th grade math
performance,to see whether the data the study has collected has a direct correspondence 
to their own student's performance.

Data Stored: The data stored will be user login accounts and the potential variables 
that effect 8th grade math performance. The potential variables that effect 8th grade
math performance will be stored into a database and will be interactive with some form 
of widget (sliders, knobs, etc).
*Possibility: Have the option to save the entry (save the data about variables used,
the results and the graph into the database for users to be able to browse)

Main Pages: 1) The login page: Users will have to login before they can interact with
the website. 2) Interactive Page: The page where users will be able to interact with 
variables that could effect 8th grade math performance.
*Possibility:3) Entries Stored page: View the entries stored by the user.
